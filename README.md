_eMAG hackathon hacks worth exploring_

# Project information

##### Project description

_A browser game that users can play while waiting for Black Friday, and much more :)._

##### Scope and benefits

_Players will emerge in a repetitive game that will track their score for an eventual prize (ex. first 10 players from leaderboards will get a voucher for x RON) while being blasted with adds on the sides of the game, while not affecting gameplay. Additionally, this game can be implemented in the 'Thank you' page and after every order, customers will get ~3 shots at the game, being tracked for the leaderboard of that month in the same idea: first x players receive a voucher consisting of x RON._
